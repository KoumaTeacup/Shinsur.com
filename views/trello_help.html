            <p dir="auto">Seeds are modular ideas that combine to form new game concepts. </p>
            <p dir="auto"><strong>To plant a new Seed:</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Click the <em>+ Add a card</em> option at the bottom of a column.</li>
                <li>Write your idea. For best results, use crisp, clear, active-voice syntax.</li>
                <li>Capitalize the key idea of the card so that it's easy to spot.</li>
                <li>Select your card and set a <em>Label</em></li>
            </ol>
            <p dir="auto">Seeds should be modular; they can stand on their own, and don't require multiple cards to make sense. </p>
            <p dir="auto">Your Seed should be a new idea. If a similar card exists, consider enhancing it with comments instead of creating a new card.</p>

                    <p dir="auto"><strong>STORY</strong> Seeds describe the hero and their journey, similar to a logline for a film.  What's the hero's goal? What's their obstacle? And how do they change?</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p dir="auto"><strong>INNOVATION</strong> Seeds propose ideas that make the core game experience fresh and distinctive.  What makes the game exceptional? What does it do first or best?</p>

                <li>
                    <p dir="auto"><strong>LOOK</strong> Seeds describe the visual style of the game. This category demands art to illustrate what's compelling about the look. What's intriguing and beautiful about the look of the game? </p>

        <h3>What are some effective ways to iterate on my pitch?</h3>
        <div dir="auto" class="current markeddown hide-on-edit js-desc js-show-with-desc">
            <p dir="auto">Developing a pitch is hard, and it takes several passes to iron out your ideas and sharpen your writing.  Here are some tactics to iterate on your pitch and make it the best it can be.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Bug your (work) friends.  Not only will they have fresh ideas to contribute, but they'll catch comprehension issues too.</li>
                <li>Ping the IP channel.  Use #ig-ip-garden in Slack to get others to read it and provide feedback.  This is also a useful resource for getting notes from other disciplines to shore up ideas you're uncertain about.</li>
                <li>Go back to the garden.  Sometimes a seed might not be strong enough.  If there's a conceptual weak point in your pitch, consider a stroll through the garden and see what fresh new ideas might be a better fit.</li>
                <li>Delve further into this FAQ column!</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <hr class="rounded">

        <h3>How can I sharpen up my idea?</h3>
        <div dir="auto" class="current markeddown hide-on-edit js-desc js-show-with-desc">
            <p dir="auto">These seven "spices" can help you punch up a mild idea into something flavorful!</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Familiar Fantasies:</strong> What situation does the player get to be in that they may have only seen or imagined in other media?</li>
                <li><strong>Payoff:</strong> What is fundamentally satisfying about the mechanical and psychological experience?</li>
                <li><strong>Reversals:</strong> How can/should we subvert expectations, given what will already be familiar to the player?</li>
                <li><strong>Spectacle:</strong> How can we push the envelope for technology and the player experience?</li>
                <li><strong>Stakes &amp; Mysteries:</strong> What are the rules or dynamics of this world that players will be forced to reckon with?</li>
                <li><strong>Suspense &amp; Cliffhangers:</strong> What story and character dynamics are in motion that the player will be able to influence?</li>
                <li><strong>The Unexpected:</strong> What did players not even realize they wanted or needed?</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h3>How else can I evaluate my idea?</h3>
        <div dir="auto" class="current markeddown hide-on-edit js-desc js-show-with-desc">
            <p dir="auto">The following four elements can help guide you in creating a new IP that demonstrates a compelling creative vision and has the best chance of success.</p>
            <p dir="auto"><strong>The Core Fantasy</strong></p>
            <p dir="auto">What's the core concept of the game and why is it broadly appealing?  This should be some kind of fantasy fulfillment that's easy to understand.  Marvel's Spider-Man has the easiest elevator pitch: you get to be Spider-Man!  With Ratchet, the player embarks on a space adventure through a colorful galaxy.  Touch on the game's basic premise here, but you don't need much narrative at this stage of the creative process.  If you're having a hard time explaining what makes your game compelling, you may need to land on a simpler and stronger core fantasy.</p>
            <p dir="auto"><strong>Innovation</strong></p>
            <p dir="auto">What new ideas does your game bring that sets it apart?  Perhaps it's a versatile new mechanic, or maybe it's a mash-up of existing concepts.  For example, the game Bleeding Edge is Overwatch but with melee combat.  Innovation can take other forms too; perhaps your game tells its story in a unique way.  Your game doesn't need to be revolutionary, but it should have a strong hook to support a novel and fresh experience.</p>
            <p dir="auto">You can also take a broader picture of innovation: with an imaginative concept, your game will be fertile ground for the team to grow their own ideas.  For example, Ratchet's longevity is in part due to its flexible premise that allows a variety of gameplay experiences to be creatively justified with each installment.</p>
            <p dir="auto">Again, focus on what makes your game innovative–we can assume it'll have other systems (like progression) to fill out the experience, but if they're not essential to the concept leave them out of the pitch.</p>
            <p dir="auto">If you're game is leaning too hard on established conventions, it may be lacking in gameplay innovation.</p>
            <p dir="auto"><strong>Personality</strong></p>
            <p dir="auto">What qualities make your game playful, charming, or cool?  Why do players want to visit this imaginative new reality?  What makes your characters endearing, cute, or badass?  What aspects of your game create moments of pure spectacle that leave players stunned and amazed?  Go ahead and double-down on your game's weird idiosyncrasies--we don't want our games to feel generic.</p>
            <p dir="auto"><strong>Fit</strong></p>
            <p dir="auto">Is your game more than the sum of its parts?  Is it tonally consistent?  Is there a type of gamer that it appeals to? Every element of your pitch should feel like it's essential to fulfilling that core fantasy–if there's too many ideas at play, consider cutting down or consolidating them so you're pitch is more focused and cohesive.</p>
            <p dir="auto">Additionally, your game should generally fall in the Insomniac / Sony house style--third-person action-adventure games that are narratively-driven and in a cinematic realism visual style.  It's certainly okay, and even encouraged, to push at some of these boundaries–we are constantly evolving–but if it's too far out there your game might not be a good fit.  Your game should also feel like it's a force for good–at this stage, a positive message is a plus, but at least avoid creating something distasteful or cynical.</p>
        </div>
        <hr class="rounded">

        <h3>What if I've already pitched my game ideas before?</h3>
        <div dir="auto" class="current markeddown hide-on-edit js-desc js-show-with-desc">
            <p dir="auto">Firstly, we want to thank you for trusting Insomniac with your original game ideas. Game development requires a tremendous amount of creative and productive energy, and we know that your passion for games and the impact they've had on your life is part of why you believe in this medium. In one way or another, we are all creating the games of our dreams.<br>.<br>.<br>If you've pitched before, hopefully you recognize some of your ideas on the board already! If not, please feel free to re-integrate them into the garden with new Seeds and Sprouts. This ultimately keeps all pitches in a common and easily readable and interchangeable format to support a harmonious and productive collaborative experience.<br>.<br>.<br>If for any reason you feel that your ideas haven't gotten a fair shake, we are available to meet with you to re-examine your concepts, together, and give them new life within this new, and hopefully improved process.</p>

        <div dir="auto" class="current markeddown hide-on-edit js-desc js-show-with-desc">
            <p dir="auto">Everything big is made up of smaller pieces. Try to beak your idea down into the smallest components you can until you reach something that none of the other Seeds can touch. The remaining pieces that don't fit into your new Seed can always be combined to strengthen or evolve existing Seeds via the Comments section in each card.</p>

            <p dir="auto">This is the beginning of a new inclusive kind of pitch process here at Insomniac. Our intention is to create a fun environment that produces viable ideas, with a balance of freedom, ownership, and quality.</p>
            <p dir="auto">If you feel that any part of this new process is not delivering on that promise, speak up, and we'll work together on making it better for everyone.</p>

        <h3>Can I pitch an existing IP?</h3>
        <div dir="auto" class="current markeddown hide-on-edit js-desc js-show-with-desc">
            <p dir="auto">Yes you can!  This process is not strictly limited to original IP; you can pitch a sequel or reimagining to an existing Insomniac title!  If you do, the process remains the same: build a Sprout out of Seeds to establish what makes the new game concept compelling.</p>
            <p dir="auto">For a refresher, Insomniac's own IP includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Resistance</li>
                <li>Sunset Overdrive</li>

        <h3>We'll measure engagement.</h3>

            <p dir="auto">Comments, reactions, and the volume of off-Trello discourse will help us understand how enthusiastic the studio is about an idea. That information will heavily influence the ideas we select for further development.</p>
        </div>
        <hr class="rounded">

        <h3>We'll discuss ideas on Slack.</h3>
        <div dir="auto" class="current markeddown hide-on-edit js-desc js-show-with-desc">
            <p dir="auto">We'll start up an IP Ideas Slack channel. There, we can dig deeper into ideas that have traction--or sharpen up ideas that need a little more work to get off the ground. </p>
        </div>
        <hr class="rounded">

        <h3>We'll select promising ideas.</h3>
        <div dir="auto" class="current markeddown hide-on-edit js-desc js-show-with-desc">
            <p dir="auto">We'll work together as a studio to identify ideas that seem especially promising--ideas that we're excited to make and play, that <em>seem</em> like they should exist in the world. There's no preconceived idea about the number; we'll let the process play out and see where we stand. If we end up with multiple ideas that have the potential to be unforgettable GOTY contenders--that's great! The conversation about our best path forward will make our 2022 pitches even stronger. </p>

            <p dir="auto">After we've selected ideas for further development, we'll hold full studio brainstorms to capture more ideas. In this way, we'll benefit from focused, discipline-centric ideation modes. Everyone in the studio will have a chance to help shape the vision.</p>

        <h3>We'll create informal strike teams.</h3>
        <div dir="auto" class="current markeddown hide-on-edit js-desc js-show-with-desc">
            <p dir="auto">After group brainstorming, we'll form strike teams to answer important questions: </p>

                <li>What's the core of this idea, and how can we make it even stronger?</li>
                <li>What's the vision statement?</li>

        <h3>And finally, we'll create Sony-facing game pitches.</h3>
        <div dir="auto" class="current markeddown hide-on-edit js-desc js-show-with-desc">
            <p dir="auto">After we have a set of ideas with traction, and a strong sense of the core premise and innovation potential of each one, we'll craft game pitches. </p>
            <p dir="auto">In each pitch, we'll tell a story about the player experience, state the vision, outline the pillars, summarize the game story, and dig deep into gameplay systems, production implications, and potential cultural impact. We'll illustrate each pitch with incredible production art.</p>
            <p dir="auto">From there, we'll share with our partners at Sony. We might share a single idea that's a clear frontrunner, or we might share 2-3 ideas that have potential. </p>
            <p dir="auto">We'll identify the next big Insomniac IP in 2022, collaborate with our partners to greenlight, and move into the planning and team-building stage immediately after that.</p>
